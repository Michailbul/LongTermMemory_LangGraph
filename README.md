# LongTerm Memory Agent

This project showcases the development of a chatbot capable of creating long-term memory agent. By integrating LangGraph with the chatbot, it dynamically updates its knowledge base based on user interactions, ensuring accurate and up-to-date responses.

## Features

- **Dynamic Knowledge Update:** Utilizes user input to continually expand and refine the chatbot's knowledge base.
- **LangGraph Integration:** Employs LangGraph to manage and navigate complex conversational paths and memory states.
- **GuardRail Implementation:** Incorporates mechanisms to filter out and avoid responding to malicious or irrelevant queries.



Execute the app to interact with the chatbot:

```bash
python LangGraph_memory.py
